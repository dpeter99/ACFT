For anyone asking for 1.16 forge here is the rundown of the process that goes into updating it.

- step 0: have vanilla decompiling and compiling again without forge on top -- this was done over the past few weeks
- step 1: have forge compiling -- this is what's being done right now, it often requires disabling patches/features temporarily
- step 2: once forge compiles and the initial set of patches can be produced, then forge can start to be properly developed, until it's in an usable state enough to actually use -- this will happen over the coming days --, then finally
- step 3: fix all the missing features (that make sense to fix), cleanup, add new hooks, etc. -- this will take some weeks, and result in the recommended build

Most of this takes a long time and people are doing it in their free time so be patient and don't ask them.
If everything goes according to plan a first forge version will be out next week or so. But this doesn't mean that mods will be updated as well. Mods (just as forge) are made by people in their free time for free. And real life should and always will be the priority.
